Working with Pandas

First attempt at data import and visualization.
This actually went really easily, although the data is lacking a breadth of information.

It would be fun to get ingredient listings and even caloric information to try and drive more reasoning behind these ratings,
however I think I'll save that as a background side project.

Please view the Jupiter notebook for code and comments.
This is mostly done, I'm moving to a new dataset for now.
