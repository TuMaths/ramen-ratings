# ramen-ratings
This is a project intended for me to grasp data handling and visualization.

I started with Numpy, initially in an attempt to handle all aspects of the project,
although it seems that Numpy is a lot better with purely numerical input, and matrixes, as opposed to mixed data (num and text)

So I'm switching to Pandas, only after just getting some basic listing to work from numpy.


##pandas
Working with Pandas made it a lot easier to read the data in, manipulate one column into floats, and then do some actual comparison.
We can notice a few things just from looking at total ramens review versus the five star reviews. This is definitely the route to take. I'll clean this up a bit, do a jupyter notebook write up and then look for more interesting data sets to work with.
