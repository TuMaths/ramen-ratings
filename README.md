This is a project intended for me to grasp data handling and visualization.

I started with Numpy, initially in an attempt to handle all aspects of the project,
although it seems that Numpy is a lot better with purely numerical input, and matrixes, as opposed to mixed data (num and text)

So I'm switching to Pandas, only after just getting some basic listing to work from numpy.
